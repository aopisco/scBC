# Tumor cell plasticity promotes metastasis across heterogeneous tumors

## Overview

Gene expression profile at single cell level of matched primary tumor and metastatic cells of breast cancer patient-derived xenograft models.

We profiled the tumor heterogeneity of individual primary tumor and matched metastatic cells of breast cancer using a set of patient derived xenograft models with different metastatic potentials. This data set gives insights into the transcriptional tumor heterogeneity, the transcriptional differences between primary tumor and matched metastatic cells and how these are changing in regard to varying metastatic phenotypes.

Data will be available at NCBI BioProject number **PRJNA847563**.
